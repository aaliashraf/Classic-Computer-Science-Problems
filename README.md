# Classic-Computer-Science-Problems
In this project we will try to solve famous computer science problems in different ways . Firstly we will analyse every problem statement and build a prototype of it, then solve it in different ways to fully understand and have grip on it. This is a part of series in this Notebook 1 there are problems related to string manipulation are solved in the next Notebook problem related to Data Structure will counter.Python Language used to encounter problem.
##### These are the things that we will learn:

* Algorithms 
* Data Structure
* String Manuplation
* Problems Solving 
* Interview Preparations 
* Quick Review of Concepts
